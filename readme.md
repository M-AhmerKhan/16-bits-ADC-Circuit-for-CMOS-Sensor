# Analog-Digital conversion circuit with an interface to a FPGA development board for an X-ray detector module of a 3D breast CT prototype


## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of an ADC electronic circuit for a CMOS sensor coupled with CsI:Tl scintillating crystals to detects X-rays. The circuit samples analog pixels data from the sensor, crucial for analyzing beam geometry and sensor-scintillator response. An FPGA interfaces with the circuit to process the digital data from three sensor channels and store it on a host computer for image processing and analysis.

## Features
- 16-bits ADC circuit for 3 channel CMOS sensor.
- Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
- Designed voltage level shifter for interfacing +3.3V Analog front end LM98725 with a +5V CMOS sensor.
- Implemented voltage clamping circuit.
- Interfacing ADC with FPGA (NI sbRIO-9651) via LabVIEW.
- PCB layout and design using EAGLE

## Tools and Technologies

- **EAGLE** for schematic capture and PCB layout
- **LabVIEW** to acquires the digital data from the ADC in a sequence, converts this data into integer values and save the complete pixels data in a text file on the computer from each sensor channel.
- **Arduino** for SPI
- **Oscilloscope** for signal testing.
- **MATLAB** for anylyzing sesor data.
