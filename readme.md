# [Analog-Digital conversion circuit with an interface to a FPGA development board for an X-ray detector module of a 3D breast CT prototype.]


## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of an ADC electronic circuit for a CMOS sensor coupled with CsI:Tl scintillating crystals to detects X-rays. The circuit samples analog pixels data from the sensor, crucial for analyzing beam geometry and sensor-scintillator response. An FPGA interfaces with the circuit to process the digital data from three sensor channels and store it on a host computer for image processing and analysis.
